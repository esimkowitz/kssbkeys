# KSSB Keys

![CI](https://github.com/esimkowitz/kssbkeys/workflows/CI/badge.svg) [![Version](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/esimkowitz.kssbkeys.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esimkowitz.kssbkeys)

This extension has been developed to provide useful commands and keyboard shortcuts to VS Code users who use a screen reader like NVDA. It is very much a work in progress.

## Features

Currently, this extension only provides two enhancements: a keyboard shortcut to create a new folder from the Explorer pane and a keyboard shortcut to create a new file from the Explorer pane.
